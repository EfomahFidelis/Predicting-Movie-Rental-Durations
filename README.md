# Predicting-Movie-Rental-Durations
A regression model which will help predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD.

<strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
In this project, I built regression models to predict the number of days a customer is likely to rent a DVD based on specific customer and movie features. The rental company sought to improve their inventory planning and operational efficiency using predictive analytics, with a key performance goal of achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3 or less on the test set.

During this analysis, I performed extensive data exploration, including visualizations and statistical analysis, to uncover critical insights. For example:  
- **Correlation Heatmap Analysis**: Revealed relationships between numerical features, aiding feature selection and reducing multicollinearity.  
- **PG Rating Distribution**: Analyzed binary distributions of PG ratings to confirm its limited influence on regression modeling.  
- **Lasso Regression Coefficients**: Showed how specific features such as rental amount and rental rate affect the predicted rental duration.  

The final model, a DecisionTreeRegressor, achieved an MSE of 2.5036, outperforming the company’s benchmark. This project highlights the power of regression modeling in enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and optimize resource planning.
